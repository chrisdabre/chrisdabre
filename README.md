## üìö About Me:
Imagine a digital battlefield, where the lines blur between code and combat. That's where I thrive. Armed with a Master's in Cybersecurity and a toolbox of advanced certifications (CompTIA Security+ (Sec+), CEH, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Google Cybersecurity, and counting), I'm a relentless hunter of vulnerabilities.

My journey began at CyberSmithSecure, where I donned the white hat of a Cyber Security Analyst. Firewalls were my forts, VPNs were my secret tunnels, and phishing attempts were my kryptonite. I sliced through vulnerabilities, wielded gap assessments like Excalibur, and deployed email shields that turned spam into harmless whispers. My efforts brought peace to the once-troubled digital realm, slashing phishing attacks and beefing up their cyber defenses. This resulted in blocking 95% of phishing emails and reduced successful phishing attempts by 70%

But the call of adventure wouldn't let me rest. Next, I donned the crimson cloak of a Cyber Security Project Intern at a Curacao. I conducted comprehensive wireless penetration tests and strategically transitioned legacy operating organizational systems to Windows 10, implementing robust controls such as a SOPHOS firewall. My commitment to security is further demonstrated through managing system integration and secure equipment relocation projects, ensuring the safeguarding of organizational assets.

But the story doesn't end there. My relentless thirst for knowledge keeps me devouring the latest cyber tactics, always evolving and innovating. I'm a warrior in the digital age, a guardian of data, and a builder of impenetrable fortresses.

My academic background and hands-on experience position me as a dedicated professional capable of addressing complex cybersecurity challenges. With a relentless drive for continuous learning and innovation, I am poised to contribute my skills and expertise to strengthen cybersecurity landscapes further.

Here's what I bring to the table:
- Vulnerability and Risk Assessment
- Proven track record of reducing security incidents and mitigating threats.
- Deep technical expertise in penetration testing, incident response, GRC, SOC, and threat intelligence.
- Strategic problem-solver with a knack for creative solutions and clear communication.
- Passionate about continuous learning and staying ahead of the cyber curve.
